attempt surprising those Indians at that Time, left if one
should escape the Town might be alarmed : so Lieut. Hinge
with twelve Men, was left to watch them, with Orders not to
fall upon them till Day break ; and our Forces turned out of
the Path, and passed by without disturbing them. About
three in the Morning, having been guided in the Woods through
the Indian Warriors at a Dance in the Town, they reached 
the River, 200 Perches below the Body of the Town, near 
a Corn Field, into which a Number of the English lodged ; it 
was a raw Night. As soon as Day appeared, and a Town 
was in seen, the Attack began on the Cornfield, through 
which our People charged, killing several of the Enemy; among 
whom was their Capt. Jacob; but this Fire had alarmed 
the War Whoop and defended themselves bravely for two Hours,
losses in the Logs. And tho Indians generally refusing Quar-
ters when offered them by our People (for they knew they would not be prisoners), Col. Armstrong received a Shot or Wound in his Shoulder ordered their Houses to be set on Fire,
they were accordingly done which brought them out of their Holes,
some however burnt out of their Houses and attempted to reach the River but were shot down; Capt. Jacobs in getting out of a Window was shot dead.—Capt. Jacobs his squaw,
and a lad called his King’s Son.—This is indeed a Num-
ber of spare Arms in their Houses loaded which went off as
the Fire came on them; and Quantities of Gun powder throwing some of their bodies a great Height into Air.
A body of Enemy being on opposite side River fired at us;
and our People having cross’d River at Distance,
as to surround our Men they collected some Indian Horses returned near Fort took away Cattle could find.
After we were thus become Masters Cornfield & Action.
