N The Printer to the PUBLIC.
PON the Encouragement given by a Number of Subscribers agreable to printed
Proposals, I now publish the firt WeekLy Gazerte, for the Province ,otP New-
HawvrsHlßE depending upon the Favour of all Gentlemen who are Friends to
N/ Learning, Religron and Liberty to countenance my Undertaking, as this is the be
ginning of Printing in this Province, so that I may go on cheerfully, and continue this Paper
i a ufeful and entertaining Manner.
I'ondnefs of News may be carried to an extreme but every Lover of Mankind must feel
a strong Desire to know what passes in the World, as well as within his own private Sphere
and particularly to be acquainted with the Affairs of his own Nation and Country—Especially
at such a I'ime as this, when the Brsz7fb Nation is engaged in a just and neceflary War with
a powerful Enemy, the Fremch,a War in which these A4merican Colonies are most nearly
interested, the Event of which must be of the utmost Importance both to us and all thé Brzzifb
Dominions, every true Englithman must be anxious to know from Time to Time the State
of our Affairs, at Home and in the Colonies.
I shall therefore take Pains to furnith my Readers with the most material News which
can be colle@ed from every Part of the World, particularly from Grear-Britain, and its De
pendencies: And great Care will be taken-that no Fa&s of Importance shall be published
but {uch as are well attested, and these shall be as particular as may be necessary. i
But besides the common News, whenever there shall be Room, and as there may be Oc
casion, this Paper will contain Extraéts from the best Authors on Points of the most ufeful
Knowledge, moral, religious or political Essays, and other such Speculations as may have a
Tendency to improve the Mind, afford any Help to Trade, Manufaétures, Husbandry, and
other ufeful Arts, and promote the public Welfare in any Respect. s
As the Press always claims Liberty in free Countries, it is presumed that none will be of
fended if this Paper discovers that Spirit of Freedom which so remarkably prevails in the
Englifb Nation: But as Liberty ought not to be abus’d, no Encouragement will be given by
the Publither to any Thing which is apparently defign’d to foment Divisions in Church or
State, nor to any Thing profane, obscene, or tending to encourage Immorality, nor to such
‘Writings as are produced by private Pique, and fill'd with personal Refle&ions and insolent
scurrilous Language. It is a great Abuse of good Sense as well as good Manners to employ
those Means which may be serviceable to the best Purposes, in the service of Vice or any
thing Indecent, or which may give Cjuﬁ: Occasion of-Offence to any persons of true Taste and
Judgment. And therefore proper Caution will be always us'd to avoid all reasonable Grounds
of Complaint on that Score. The

ANTIGU A, August 28.
ON Thursday last arrived here his Majesty’s Ships the
Edinburg, of 74 Guns, Capt. Langdon, on board of
which it is said Admiral Frankland will hoist his Flag,
and the Augusta of 60, Capt. Wickham, with Merchantmen
under Convoy In the Augusta, came together with his lady
and Sifter, James Ross, Esq; Col. of his Majesty’s 38th
Regiment of Foot.
The Augusta in her Passage spoke with a Vessel from Gib
raltar, the Master of which said that Sir Edward Hawke ar
rived at Gibraltar the 23d of June, and sail’d from thence the
next Day for Minorca.
Aug. 31. Yesterday arrived here the Snow Sally, Capt.
Barton, in 27 Days from Gibraltar, from whom we received
the following Articles of Intelligence The Day after the
Engagement between the two Fleets the French Fleet appear
ed offt Minorca, when a Report prevailed that they had surk
and destroyed the Englich Fleet; and a Flag of 4mce was
sent into the Garrison, desiring they would surrender, for if
not, the Enemy did not doubt having it in a few Days,'and
then no. Quarters would be granted. ‘The gallant General
Blakeney dismiss’d the Flag of Truce, and gave them an
Answer by Cannon Ball and Bomb Shells: The Execution
that Day was upwards of 1000 Men kill'd, when a Parley
was beat for leave to bury the dead. Soon after the French
upon a Breach put in Execution a bold Attempt, when a
Mire was sprung by our General, which blew up a Battalion,
and occasioned their beating a second Parley to bury the dead.
This Mine being a principal one in the Defence of the Gar
rison, General Blakeney now took that Opportunity to send
a Flag of Truce, with a Proposal of Capitulation; every
Thing was granted, and the French march’d in the next Day,
being the 29th of June: During our Forces stay, they did
Duty as the French; a strong Friendship subsisted, and the
English march’d out with all the Honours of War, and were
sent to Gibraltar at the French King’s Expence.
‘The Duke de Richelieu told General Blakeney, that if Byng
bad landed his Forcesyas he might have done, he had Orders
from his Master to nail up the Cannon, and embark immedi
ately for France.. We loft 170 Ofhicers and Men the French
between 4 5000. i
Admirals Hawke and Saunders being sent to take the Com
mand, Byng and Weft were ordered home, as are the Ge
nerals Fowke and Stuart. Hawke sail’d from Gibraltar the
gth of July, with 19 Sail of Men of War and Troops on
board, to reinforce the Garrison of St. Philips; not knowing
that it was surrendred. Our Forces from Minorca, arrived
at Gibralter 5 days before Capt. Barton sail’d, which makes
the Garrison 10000 strong. \])3\; some Accounts. there is In
telligence of several Men of War with Soldiers on board, for
the Mediterranean and General Blakeney doubts not but a
few Months will reinstate him.an St. Philips.
The following Articles are the most material by yesterday's Mail.
The French firft landed with 15000, som» Accounts c3y
17000, and were reintorced wi'h 4000 whereas we had not
3ooco at firft, and no Reinforcement.
44 HALLIF AX, September 11.
On Saturday last arrived here a French Prize Schooner sent
in by the Fleet taken oft Louifbourg, her Cargo consists of
€hip Timber, some Eread and Fish, &c. She 1s to be fitted
out as a Privateer, to carry ‘lO Carriage and 20 Swivel Guns,
is*to be mann’d out of the Fleet, and employ’d by them as a
Tender.
Sepr. 18. Last Sunday arrived the Privateer Shallop com
mandéd by Capt. Piggot, who sail’d from hence about a Fort
night before, having taken six Prizes, all .small French
Schooners, one of which she brought in with her, another has
since arrived, and the rest are daily expected.
The same Day an English fishing Schooner arrived here,
which had been re-taken from a French Privateer, by Capt.
Mc’Nemara, in the Privateer Schooner Wasp, belonging to
this Place Capt. Mc’Nemarg tarried no longer with her than
to shift Hands; and then stood away after the French Privateer.
Several Vessels have arrived here within this Week past, the
Masters of which affirm that they have been' chased by a
Schooner which they took to be a French Privateer, and some
of them even within Sight of this Harbour. A
Thurday arrived a I'rench Prize Sloop, taken by the
Fogeaux her.Cargoe, consists of Furrs, Fish, &c.
Yesterday .Morning arriv’d here his Majesty’s Sloop, Ja
maica from the Fleet off Louitburg, which she left cruzing
on their Station, a// well We hear she left the Fleet in Com
pany with a Prize Snow, a Vessel of Force, taken by the
FPogeaux She also in her Passage hither took a French
Brigantine, which with the Snow, she parted with two Days
ago in a Fog; both which are hourly expeted in here. 'lhe
Jamaica also, off 'this Harbour, reliev’d a Schooner from Bos
ton, Capt. Storer, bound to this Port, who was then in Chase
by a French Privateer, who upon espying the Jamaica, stood
off and gave over the Chase. She is a large Schooner, her
upper Works and Masts painted with Spanish Brown, carries
eight Guns, besides Swivels, and is a good Sailer.
And Yesterday about 10 o’Clock, the Jamaica set sail again
in quest of the said French Privateer.
PHILADELPHTIA, Sept. 23.°
Saturday last arrived an Express from Col. Armstrong, of
Cumberland County, with Advice, that he marched from
Fort Shirley on the joth patft, with about 300 of our Provin
cial Forces, on an Expedition against Kittanning, a Town of
our Indian Enemies-on the Ohio, about 25 Miles above Fort
Duquesne. On the 3d Inst. he joined the advanced Party at
the Beaver Dams, near Franks-Town and on the 7th in the
Evening, being within six Miles of Kittarining, the Scout dis
covered a Fire in the Road, and reported that there were but
2, or at most 4 Indians at it. It was not thought proper to
attempt surprizing those Indians at that Time, left if one
should escape the Town might bé alarmed: so Licut. Hogg
with twelve Men, was left to watch them, with Orders not to
full upon them till Day break and our Forces turned out
of the Path, and passed by without diturbing them. About
three in tge Moruning, having been guided by the Whooping
ot the Indian Warriors at a Dance in the Town, they reached
the River, 100 Perches below the Body of the Town, near
a Corn lield, m which a Number of the Enemy lodged, as it
was a warm Night. As soon as Day appear’d, and the Town
could be seen, the Attack began in the Cornfield, through
which our People charged, kilhing several of the Enemy, and
entered the Town. Cupt. Jucobs, Chiet of the Tndians, gave
the War Whoop, and detended his House bravely. thro® Loop
holes in the Logs. And the Indians generally refusing Quar
ters, which were offered thein, declating they were Men, and
would not be Prisoners. Col. Armstrong (who received a
Wound in his Shoulder) ordered their Houses to be set on
I'ire, which was immediately done., When the Indians were
told they would be. burnt it they did not surrender, one of
them teply’d, he did not care, as he could kill four or five be
fore he died; and as the Hecat approached, some began to
sing, some however burst eut of the Houses, and attempted to
reach the River, but were shot down- Capt. Jacobs in getting
out of a Window was shot, and scalped, as also his Squaw,
and a lLad called’ the King’s Son. The Indians had a Num
ber of spare Arms in their Houses, loaded, which went off as
the Fire came to them; and Quantities of Gun powder which
had been stored in every House, blew vp from tine to time,
throwing some of their Bodies a great Height into the Air.
A Body of the Enemy on the opposite Side of the River, fired
on our People, and being seen to cross the River at a Distance,
as if to surround our Men, they colleéted some Indian Horses
that were near the Town, to carry ofl’ the wounded, and then
retreated without going back to the Cornfield to pick up the
Scalps of those killed there in the Beginning of the “Action.
Several of the Enemy were also killed in the River as they
were attempting to escape: And it was computed that in all
between thirty. and forty were defiroyed though ive: brought
off but 12 Scalps- Eleven English Prisoners were released
and brought away, who informed the Col. that besides the
Powder (of which the Indians boasted they had enough for
ten Years War with the English) there was a great Quantity
of Goods burnt, which the I'rench had made them a Present
of but ten. Days before. The Prisoners also informed, that
that very Day, two Battoes of French Men, with a Jarge Party
of Delaware and French Indians were to join Capt. Jacobs,
to march and take Fort Shirley; and that 25 Warriors had
set out before them the pgeceding Evening, which proved to
be the Party that had kindled the Fire Night before; for our
People returning, found Lieut. Hogg wounded in 3 Places,
and learnt he had in the Morning attacked the suppos’d Party
of 3 or 4 at the Fire, according to Order, but found them too
numerous for him. He kill’d 3of them however at the firft
Fire, and fought them an Hour, when having loft 3 of his best
Men, the rest, as he lay wounded, abandoned him and fled,
the Enemy pursuing them. Lieut. Hogg died soon after of
his. Wounds.- Capt. Mercer being wounded in the Aétion,
was carried off by his Ensign and 11 Men, who left the main
Body in theiz Return to take another Road, and were not
come in when the Express came away. He had 4of the re
covered Prisoners with him, and some of the Scalps.
On the whole, it is allowed to be the greatest Blow the
FEicmy have received since the War began, and it well follow-
ed may soon muke them weary of continuing it. The Con
duét ot Col. Artuftrong in marching so large a Body thro’ the
Enemy’s Country, without being discovered, is deservedly ad
mired and applauded, as well as the Bravery of both Othicers
and Men in the Aétion. And we hope their Example may
have all the good Effects that are naturally to be expected
from it.
In the whole we had 17 killed, 13 wounded, and 19 missing.
Since receiving the above Return from Fort Littleton, we
are informed Capt. Mercer, and 23 Persons, are returned safe,
which makes up the Number of the Missing, and the four
released Prisoners.
Capt. Bryce, arrived in Maryland from Barbados, advises,
that on tte gth ult. between the latitudes 21 and 22, he
was chased by 1o Sail of Men of War six Hours (whether
French or English he could not tell) but he outsailing them,
they stood to the Northward.
NEW-Y ORK, September 27.
Captain Dwight came up last Wednesday Evening, in the
“Prize Ship Chavalmarin, Mons. Despasarius, late Master, taken
the 3ift of August, by the Privateer Brig Prince George, Capt.
King, of this Port, as mentioned in our last. ar
Saturday Evening last Captain Ashfield arrived here in a
Sloop (Alexander Hope late Master) from Africa, but last
from Santa Croix, in 11 Days, and acquaints us, That about
two Months ago, 100 Leagues from the Coast, 6 or 7 Slaves
that were upon Deck, watch’d an Opportunity when he and
some more of the Crew were in the Hold, rush’d into the
Cabbin, knocked Capt. Hope’s Brains out, wounded Mr.
Charles Duncan the second Mate in several Places, secured all
the Arms, and kept Possession of the Cabbin for four Hours.
Charles Duncan with Difliculty got out of the Cabbin, and
with the Assistance of Mr. Ashfield and the Cooper got the
Deoor shut upon the Negroes; they then discharged all the
Muskets and Blunderbusses at the Crew, thro’ the Door, but
hurt none of them. The Negroes having discharged all their
Pieces, Mr. Ashfield and the Cooper rush’d into the Cabbin
upon them, disarm’d the Slaves, and recovered the Vessel.
The Ringleader of the Slaves jump’d over board and was
drown’d. Mr. Ashfield receéived several Wounds as did the
Cooper, but are both pretty well.
We expett in about 6 Weeks to have 25 Privateers cut
from this Port.
The same Day, CaPtain James White, of the Ship Prince-
Galley, arrived here from Waterford, in Ireland, with Pro
visions for his Majesty’s Forces in this Province.
Yesterday Morning Capt. Pell in the Privateer Sloop Mary,
of this Port, returned here from a Cruize of 8 Weeks, from
whom we have the following Particulars, viz. In Lat. 33, 56,
Lon. 61, 40. Capt. Pell spoke with Capt. Bickers, in the
Bradstreet Privateer, of this Port.- August 29, he spoke with
a Sloop from Antigua for Newfoundland, who informed him,
that two Days before he spoke with Capt. Grantham, in the
Privateer Sloop Hardy, of this Port also, all well on board,
but had met with nothing. Anuguft 30, at Day break, Capt.
Pell found himself in the midst of seven French Vessels, one
of which he immediately took, man’d and brought off, and
after having her in Possession four Hours, was (firft taking
out- his People) obliged to quit her, being chased by two
French Men of War, one of 74 Guns, and the other of 64,
their Convoy: A [Frigate of 36 Guns, was then in.Chace
of a Sloop, which Capt. Pell imagined was Capt. Grantham.
Sept. 2d, Early in the Morning, Capt. Pell fell in with the
same Fleet The I'rench “Commodore immediately g“avc
Chace, fired several Shot at him, and with Difficulty he
escaped being taken. Sept. 5. *Captain Pell tell in with five
Sail of French Merchantmen, who all hoisted English Co
lours: He immediately engaged two of them within Pistol
Shot, one a Ship of 12 Guns and 40 Men; the other a'Snow
of 10 Guns and 35 Men: The Ship endeavoured to run
Capt. Pell down, but he prevented her, by giving- her such
a Brogdaide, as made her glad to sheer off:- He then run
along Side of the Snow, and gave her another Broadside,
when. she struck her Colours; but the Privateer having fresh
Way, she hoisted her Colours again, and jomned the Rett of the
of the Fleet. The same Afternoon Capt. Pell fell on another
Ship of 14 Guns and 45 Men, and after exchanging two
Broadsides, the Sea running high, and the rest of the Ships
coming down upon him, was obliged to quit her.
The remainder of this must be deferr’d to another Opportunity.
New York, Sept. 27. ‘Thursday last, a Frenchman supposed
to be a Spy, was brought here from Albany, where he was
sccured by Order of the Earl of London, and is committed
to our Goal.
The same Morning Capt. Jauncey arrived here in 23 Days,
from Jamaica. He was ten Days in the Windward Passage,
without seeing a Vessel of any Nation whatever. There are
now on the Jamaica Station, 2 Ships of 60 Guns, 1 of 50,
1 of 40, and 2 of 20 Guns, and 3 others of 707 and 8o Guns
each, daily expected there.
Camp at Lake George, Sept. 20, 1756.
Yesterday one of our Scouts, consisting of 48 Men, com
manded by Capt. Hodges, were ambush’d and fired upon by a
larger Party of Indians about 12 -Miles off, on the Weft
Side of the Lake our Men fought them about half an Hour,
but several of them being kill'd by the firft Fire of the Enemy,
who with superiour Numbers had the Advantage of the
Ground, and had almost surrounded them, our Party were
forced to give way and run off, and were closely pursued by the
Indians: Only sos the Party are yet returned alive. Imme
diately upon the News, a fresh Party was sent down to their
Relict, in one of the Sloops, with two Whale Boats: In the
Evening one of the Boats returned, and brought the Bodies of
the Captain and g others that were found dead on the Place of
Action, scalped and mangled in a very cruel inhuman Manner,
and 3 of their Heads cut off: We fear most of the others
are fallen into the Enemy’s Hands. This Day two of our Men
being out in a Swamp at a small Distance from the Camp,
without their Arms, were fired upon by an Indian, but not
_wounded, on which they ran away and were pursued by the
Indian, who overtook one of them, a young Lad, and ftabb’d
and scalped him before we could give him any Assistance.
B O S T ON, Oétober 4.
Besides the Articles mentioned under Halifax, we are since
informed from thence, that Capt. Spry had taken a French
Sloop from Canada, laden with Furs, Fish, also a Snow
of Force and a Brigantine from the same Place. ’Tis said
_ Capt. Spry had wrote to Governor Lawrence, that the Matfter
of the Spow told him, that the Garrison of Ofwego, 15,00 in
Number, arrived at Canada while he was there, and that he
~was informed the French did not lose a Man in the Reduétion
of that Place--++That several Vessels had been chased off

Works and Masts painted with Spanish Brown, and that the
Famaica Sloop of War was gone out in-quest of her. Itis
also reported, that Capt. Rous had taken a Fremch Privateer
Brigantine of 14 Guns and 150 Men.
We have a long confused and uncertain Accoynt of the
taking of Ofwego Fort, given and signed by one Fobn Gael,
who belonged to one of the Sloops on Lake Onrario, and
who made his Escape #rom the Enemy with 3 others, the
Evening after the Surrender of the Fort. To this Account 1s
annexed the Names of the Officers belonging to the 3 Regi
ments of which sthe Garrison consisted; but as they were all
made Prisoners, and carried to Canada, and as every one who
had Friends or Relations among them now knows. their Fate,
think it needless to insert their Names here.
Monday last, his Majesty’s Ship Mermaid (on board of which
is his Excellency Governor SHIRLEY) sail'd from this Port for
England.
T'uesday lat, being Training-Day at Castle William, in
firing one of the 42 Pound Cannon, it split to pieces, by
which Mr. Seaver, a Quarter-Gunner, was kill’d on the
Spot, one had his Lég so terribly shattered that it has since
been cut offs another was much wounded in his Head and
Side, and several others reccived some Hurt, but ’tis hoped
they will all do well.
