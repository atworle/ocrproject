ANTIGUA, August 28.
On Thursday last arrived here his Majesty's Ships the Edinburgh, of 74 Guns, Capt. Langdon, on board of which it is said Admiral Frankland will hoist his Flag, and the Augusta, of 60, Capt. Walsingham, with Merchantmen under Convoy: In the Augusta, came together with his Lady and Sister, James Ross, Esq; Col. of his Majesty's 38th Regiment of Foot.
The Day after her Passage spoke with a Vessel from Gibraltar, the Master of which said that Sir David Hawke arrived at Gibraltar the 3d of June, and sailed from thence the next Day for Minorca.
Aug. 31. Yesterday arrived here the Snow Sally, Capt. Barton, in 27 Days from Gibraltar, from whom we received the following Articles of Intelligence â€” The Day after the Engagement between the two Fleets the French Fleet appeared off Minorca, when a Report prevailed that they was landed, and Gibraltar being in want of Provisions, it was not in the Power of the English to send any Relief there, and the Enemy did not doubt having it in a few Days, for since the raising of the Flag of Truce, and granting an Answer by Cannon Ball and Bomb Shells; the Execution that Day was upwards of 1000 Men killed on the French Side, and 1500 on ours, and the Garrison was put upon a Breast put in Execution a bold Attempt, wherein was engaged by our General, and the Enemy by a certain Admiral, which being a Consequence of the Treaty of Peace, and the principal one of the Opportunity to send Troops, General Blakeney took that Opportunity to carry a Flag of Truce, and a Proposal of Capitulation to the French, which was refused, and the Flag of Truce being shot at, June 1. During our Forces stay they did the French a terrible Mischief, and they did the English as good, and at the Honour of War, and were sent to Gibraltar at the French King's Expence.
The Duke of Richelieu told General Blakeney, that if Byng had landed 4000 Men he could not have taken the Island, and that he hoped he would not come again, for the French were prepared. We lost 19 Officers and Men by the French Cannon.
The French Hand and Saunders being sent to the Command, Byng and West were ordered home, as are the Generals Fowke and Stuart. Hawke and Grantham are ordered to bring 5 Sail of Men of War to Gibraltar, in order to reinforce the Garrison of St. Philips, not knowing what Success attends our Forces. This Morning arrived here in 3 Days, the Capt. Barton, who took the Garrison aboard, and brought them to Barbadoes, for Intelligence several Men of War with Soldiers on board, for the reinforcement; and General Blakeney doubts not but a few Months will reinstate him in St. Philips.

The French first landed with 15000, some Accounts say 17000, and were reinforced with 4000; whereas we had but 3000 at first, and no Reinforcement.
HALLIFAX, September 1.
On Saturday last arrived here a French Prize Schooner sent in by the Fleet taken and plundered, her Cargo consists of Ship Timber, some Bread and Fish, &c. She is to be fitted out as a Privateer, to carry 10 Carriage and 50 Swivel Guns, and is manned out of the Fleet, and employed by his Majesty's Ship.
Sept. 8. Last Sunday arrived the Privateer Shallop commanded by Capt. Fogg, who took her about 4 Fortnight before, having taken six Prizes, all small French Schooners, one of which she brought in with her, another has since arrived, and the rest are expected.
The same Day an English fishing Schooner arrived here, which had been retaken from a French Privateer, by Capt. Smith, near Cape Breton; she was taken about a Fortnight before, and the French had plundered her, and put 5 of their Hands, and then stood away after the French Privateer.
Thursday arrived from this Harbour, Capt. Fogg, in the Schooner which they took to be a French Privateer, and was afterwards retaken with a French Prize.
The same Day an English Schooner, taken by the Fogueaux, her Cargo consists of Furs, Fish, &c.
Yesterday Morning arrived the Privateer's Sloop, James, of this Port, Capt. Fogg, who took her about 12 Cruizers near Cape Breton, where she had been taken by the Enemy with a Prize Snow, a Vessel of Force, taken by the French, and retaken by us. She brought in 2 French Prizes, one of which she had retaken, the other was taken by Capt. Fogg, both which are hourly expected in here.
