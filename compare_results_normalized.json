every house blew vp from tine to time throwing some of their bodies a great height into the air a body of the enemy on the opposite side of the river fired on our people and being seen to cross the river at a distance as if to surround our men they colle ted some indian horses that were near the town to carry ofl the wounded and then retreated without going back to the cornfield to pick up the scalps of those killed there in the beginning of the action several of the enemy were also killed in the river as they were attempting to escape and it was computed that in all between thirty and forty were defiroyed though ive brought off but 12 scalps eleven english prisoners were released and brought away who informed the col that besides the powder of which the indians boasted they had enough for ten years war with the english there was a great quantity of goods burnt which the i rench had made them a present of but ten days before the prisoners also informed that that very day two

return to take another road and were not come in when the express came away he had 4of the re covered prisoners with him and some of the scalps on the whole it is allowed to be the greatest blow the feicmy have received since the war began and it well follow ed may soon muke them weary of continuing it the con du t ot col artuftrong in marching so large a body thro the enemy s country without being discovered is deservedly ad mired and applauded as well as the bravery of both othicers and men in the a tion and we hope their example may have all the good effects that are naturally to be expected from it in the whole we had 17 killed 13 wounded and 19 missing since receiving the above return from fort littleton we are informed capt mercer and 23 persons are returned safe which makes up the number of the missing and the four released prisoners capt bryce arrived in maryland from barbados advises that on tte gth ult between the latitudes 21 and 22 he was chased by 1o sail of men of

reprinted by peter n foulkes oct 7 1856 thursday october 7 1756 the new hampshire gazette with the freshest advices foreign and domestick the printer to the public upon the encouragement given by a number of subscribers agreeable to printed proposals i now publish the first weekly gazette for the province of new hampshire depending upon the favour of all gentlemen who are friends to learning religion and liberty to countenance my undertaking as this is the be ginning of printing in this province so that i may go on cheerfully and continue this paper in a useful and entertaining manner fondness of news may be carried to an extreme but every lover of mankind must feel a strong desire to know what passes in the world as well as within his own private sphere and particularly to be acquainted with the affairs of his own nation and country especially at such a time as this when the british nation is engaged in a just and necessary war with a powerful enemy the french a war in which these american colonies are most nearly interested the event of which must be of the utmost importance both to us and all the british dominions every true englishman must be anxious to know from time to time the state of our affairs at home and in the colonies i shall therefore take pains to furnish my readers with the most material news which can be collected from every part of the world particularly from great britain and its de pendencies and great care will be taken that no facts of importance shall be published but such as are well attested and these shall be as particular as may be necessary but besides the common news whenever there shall be room and as there may be oc casion this paper will contain extracts from the best authors on points of the most useful knowledge moral religious or political essays and other such speculations as may have a tendency to improve the mind afford any help to trade manufactures husbandry and other useful arts and promote the public welfare in any respect as the press always claims liberty in free countries it is presumed that none will be of fended if this paper discovers that spirit of freedom which so remarkably prevails in the english nation but as liberty ought not to be abused no encouragement will be given by the publisher to any thing which is apparently design d to foment divisions in church or state nor to any thing profane obscene or tending to encourage immorality nor to such writings as are produced by private pique and fill d with personal reflections and insolent scurrilous language it is a great abuse of good sense as well as good manners to employ those means which may be serviceable to the best purposes in the service of vice or any wicked intention or which may give just occasion of offence to any persons of true taste and judgment and therefore proper caution will be always us d to avoid all reasonable grounds of complaint on that score the publisher will esteem it a great favour to be well supplied by correspondents of genius and generous sentiments with such speculations or essays as may be pleasing and instructive to the public agreeable to the design of this paper and acknowledge himself obliged to any gentleman who will take the pains to communicate to him any good intelligence provided they be sent free from charge the following articles are the most material by

garrison was put upon a breast put in execution a bold attempt wherein was engaged by our general and the enemy by a certain admiral which being a consequence of the treaty of peace and the principal one of the opportunity to send troops general blakeney took that opportunity to carry a flag of truce and a proposal of capitulation to the french which was refused and the flag of truce being shot at june 1 during our forces stay they did the french a terrible mischief and they did the english as good and at the honour of war and were sent to gibraltar at the french king s expence the duke of
